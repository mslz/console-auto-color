# console-auto-color README

Visual Studio Code extension for automatic console output coloring.

## Features

The extension replaces `console` logging methods by applying pre-configured ANSI color codes to console parameters. This tool detects methods with empty parenthesis, like `console.info()` and substitutes the selected line with appropriate input while focusing the cursor selection on the beginning of a message to print.

## Requirements

- vscode: "^1.71.0"
